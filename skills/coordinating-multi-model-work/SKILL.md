# Coordinating Multi-Model Work

## Overview

Use this module to decide whether to call **Codex** (backend), **Gemini** (frontend), and/or **Cursor** (code quality) via MCP tools, and to enforce a consistent evidence protocol.

This module is intentionally minimal: it provides a small workflow and pushes details into reference files.

## Core Instruction for CodeX MCP/ Gemini MCP

At any time, you must consider how the current process can collaborate with Codex/Gemini and how to call the MCP tools they provide to ensure objective, comprehensive analysis.
You **must** execute the steps below:
**1** After forming an initial analysis of the user request, share the request and your initial thinking with Codex/Gemini and ask them to improve the requirement analysis and implementation plan.
**2** Before implementing any concrete coding task, **you must ask Codex/Gemini for a code prototype (they must provide only a unified diff patch and must not make any real code changes)**. After receiving the prototype, you may **only** use it as logical reference, then rewrite your own production-grade, highly readable, highly maintainable code before making changes.
**3** Whenever you complete real coding work and `Routing != CLAUDE`, **you must immediately use Codex/Gemini to review the code changes and requirement coverage**.
**3.5** Whenever code changes are complete, **use Cursor (`mcp__cursor__cursor`) for code quality review**. Cursor reviews for bugs, edge cases, readability, maintainability, and performance. This is automatic — Cursor is not a routing target but a universal quality layer. See `coordinating-multi-model-work/INTEGRATION.md` for the invocation template.
**4** Codex/Gemini/Cursor provide references only. You **must** think independently and even question their answers. Blind trust is worse than no trust; your joint mission is to converge on a unified, comprehensive, precise result, which requires continuous debate to reach the truth.

## The Two Rules

1. **Main rule (Fail-Closed Gate):** If you decide `Routing != CLAUDE`, you MUST obtain external output, or STOP in `BLOCKED`.

2. **Early exposure:** If you decide `Routing != CLAUDE`, run the external call **before** doing real work (writing code, generating tests, or producing final conclusions).

## Checkpoint Workflow

At skill checkpoints (CP1/CP2/CP3):

1. Decide routing using `coordinating-multi-model-work/routing-decision.md`
2. If `Routing != CLAUDE`, apply `coordinating-multi-model-work/GATE.md` immediately (evidence or BLOCKED)
3. Continue only after evidence is recorded
